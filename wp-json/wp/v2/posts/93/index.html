A fun new option for you to try is wall stenciling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This simple technique can elevate any room and offer you something fun and exciting to try. Wall stenciling is also a very easy process, so if you\u2019re new to it and just starting out, you don\u2019t need to stress and worry about things going wrong. Let\u2019s take a quick look at everything you need to know about wall stenciling to ensure that your stenciling project turns out great:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Don\u2019t Cheap Out On The Quality Of The Stencils<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The quality of the stencils you use will play a huge role in how your walls turn out. Our number one piece of advice is to get high-quality stencils. The stencils should be thick, flexible, and large enough to work with.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re planning on making a repetitive pattern, the stencils should have a repeating image in one corner to help you get the placement right. Stencils can cost anywhere between $10 to $50, depending on which company you buy from. Don&#8217;t risk saving a few dollars if it ends up with a badly stenciled wall.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Ensure That Your Stencils Are Stuck To The Wall Securely To Avoid Bleeding<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re a seasoned pro, simply holding the stencils to the wall while you paint isn\u2019t the best idea. Your hand could slip, you may need to re-dip your paintbrush, or the paint may bleed onto the wall.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Instead, stick your stencil securely to the wall before you start painting. While most people use tape, you can also try a spray adhesive. Spray adhesive can leave a sticky residue on the walls, but you can wipe that off with a simple cleaning the next day.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Choose A Simple And Random Pattern For Your First Time<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Wall stencils come in all kinds of patterns. Some patterns are repetitive and linear, meaning that the stencil placement needs to be perfectly lined up to get the pattern right.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This can be difficult for a beginner to do, especially if some of the walls in your house or the floor level isn\u2019t exactly straightforward. We suggest starting with a random stencil pattern to avoid this trouble.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>A Little Bit Of Paint Goes A Long Way<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our last piece of advice for stenciling beginners is to use a very little bit of paint when painting over the stencils. Load some paint onto your brush, dab the brush off on some kitchen towels, and then blot it carefully onto the stencil.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like, you can always go over it with a second coat of paint. Too much paint at once can lead to dripping and bleeding, which can ruin the overall look of the wall.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Keep these tips in mind when trying out wall stencils, and we\u2019re sure that you\u2019ll find the process super easy and end up with some amazing wall d\u00e9cor!<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re redecorating some of the rooms in your house, you may want to think about taking your wall d\u00e9cor to the next level beyond just paint and wallpaper.
