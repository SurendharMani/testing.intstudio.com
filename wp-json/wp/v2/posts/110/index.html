The critical difference between bathroom flooring and other rooms is that you need waterproof flooring in the bathroom. While that is a significant factor to consider, the durability of the flooring should be the top priority unless you wish to change the flooring often.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Porcelain And Ceramic Tile<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The best option for bathroom flooring is tile. There are numerous shapes, sizes, colors, and textures available in the market, and you can pick what you most like.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Porcelain and ceramic tiles are the ideal options. Not only are they waterproof, but these give a polished and expensive look to the bathroom.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Natural Stone<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Natural stone is also one of the best options for bathroom flooring \u2013 it is highly durable and attractive. The stones will give a refined look to the washroom and make it look like you\u2019ve significantly invested in it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The best part is that it is entirely waterproof and inexpensive. If you\u2019re thinking from a long-term perspective, natural stone tiles are an excellent way to elevate the resale value.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Vinyl<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Vinyl has gained immense popularity in the past few years as a great bathroom flooring option. Not only is it waterproof, but highly economical and easy to install. It is available as tiles, sheets, or planks in the market.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are two types \u2013 wood and stone; however, both are equally functional. Even though it won\u2019t impact the resale value, it undoubtedly keeps your bathroom floor looking great through the years to come.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Concrete<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Concrete bathroom floors are present in the home where there are slab foundations. This concrete flooring can be painted, polished, or stamped to match the aesthetic of your home. The benefit of this flooring is that it keeps your bathroom flooring away from water damage.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It will last you years and is one of the most cost-effective options. One drawback of concrete flooring is that it can become even more challenging and colder for homeowners to adjust to in winter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Fixed Wood<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Water and wood are not a good match, but this engineered wood includes a water-resistant plywood base. Wood is your best bet if you wish to give your little cottage a warm and cozy flooring look.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is prone to damage and is a relatively pricier option. One other type of wood to look at is solid hardwood. However, wood is the last option you should consider.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whichever material you choose, ensure that bathroom flooring is waterproof. Your bathroom is the most high-moisture environment in the house, so it needs to be highly durable.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to choosing the best flooring materials for your bathroom, most homeowners think along the lines of how it will look.
