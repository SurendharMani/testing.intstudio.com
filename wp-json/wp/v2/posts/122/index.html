Are you tired of plain white walls and underwhelming spaces? Maybe now is the time to consider bold and flashy design when it comes to home d\u00e9cor and styling.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A lot of people think that small spaces need to be kept simple for fear of making a space overwhelming or claustrophobic. There is also a sense of hesitancy in making a bold decision because what if you realize that you don\u2019t like what you\u2019ve picked or change your mind about it later?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re here to let you know that you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of making a bold choice! If you end up with something you don\u2019t like, you can probably change it later. You may also even surprise yourself by stepping out of your comfort zone and choosing a more daring design aspect.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re still a bit unsure, you can start with a small space in your room, such as a closet! These are some ways in which you can incorporate big and bold design aspects into a small space.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Move Away From Plain Walls<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Plain white walls are a thing of the past as far as we\u2019re concerned. Wallpaper is making strides this year, and you have an incredible array of styles and prints to choose from.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Wallpaper is also a very simple and easy way to incorporate a theme into your closet if you want to. If you\u2019re not too fond of wallpaper, consider a dark or bold shade of paint and add art and custom prints to break up the monotony of your walls.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Choose A Statement Piece<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A small space such as a closet cannot be filled with too many clashing pieces of art or furniture. It would be best if you chose one statement piece and modeled the rest of the space around that. In the case of a closet, consider an ornate mirror or a dresser to be your statement piece. Your choice should also add function to your room since it is already a small space.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Don\u2019t Shy Away From The Details<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As they say, the devil is in the details. The way to take a regular boring space and transform it into a space that is bold, daring, and stylistically advanced is to pay special attention to the details. If you end up choosing wallpaper for the closet, you can paint the trim and sidings in the space to match with an accent color in the wallpaper.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you have built-in shelves, consider adding wallpaper inside the shelves as well as on the walls. Another small detail that goes a long way is matching all the hardware, such as the light fixtures and door handles, and knobs, so that they are all in the same metal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is that even if you have a very small space to work with, you can, and you should incorporate different and bold style aspects in that space. Try out some of the ideas we have mentioned and see how much you can transform your closet from dull and boring to bold and daring.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you ever feel like the dull monotony of life is translating into your home?
