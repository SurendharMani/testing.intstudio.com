				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_0">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_0  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_0  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Some homes and apartments have lots of extra space, natural light, or even small gardens and backyards. However, not all of us are so lucky when it comes to space and sunlight. While you may not be able to have the luscious garden of your dreams, there are many plants that can be kept indoors in small spaces with reduced or indirect light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re looking to keep plants indoors these plants are all great options for you. All these plants do well indoors, can survive – and even thrive – with little to no light, and are incredibly beautiful, too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Golden Pothos</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Golden Pothos is probably the easiest to care for out of all other houseplants. This plant can make any space look more alive with its bright green and yellow dappled leaves and long vines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pothos will do well in almost any kind of soil, with little to no light and watering once or twice a week. When the vines grow long and unruly, you can cut them off and transfer them to some water, and then you&#8217;ll have a whole new plant in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>ZZ Plant</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ZZ Plant is a plant that has a distinct and unique appearance. It grows upright and in a compact style so that it doesn&#8217;t take up too much space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t need much light and does well in indirect light, meaning that it is perfect for rooms with small windows or no direct sunlight. You can also just set it up and forget about it since it doesn&#8217;t need watering until its soil has completely dried up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Snake Plant</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Snake Plant, like the ZZ, grows upright and compact. It is incredibly easy to care for, and some might even go as far as to say that it is impossible to kill. The Snake Plant all but thrives on neglect. It doesn&#8217;t need much light and can be watered once a week or even once in two weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Spider Plant</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Spider Plant is a beautiful one we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve heard of. This classic plant is easy to keep healthy and produces many tiny offshoots that can be made into new plants if potted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plant doesn’t need much fuss, with little light and water needed. And, as a bonus, if you’ve got cats at home, they’re going to love nibbling on this plant and chewing on its leaves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Braided Money Tree</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want an indoor tree, the Braided Money Tree is an excellent choice. This tree has a distinct look with its braided trunk and is compact enough to keep indoors. Not only is it easy to keep alive and very beautiful, but it is also considered a symbol of good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what do you think? Will you be buying some of the plants we&#8217;ve mentioned on your next trip to the nursery? We think that any one of these plants will make a beautiful addition to your small space and help brighten it up.</p></div>

<div class="et_pb_section et_pb_section_1 et_section_regular" >
				
				
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_1">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_1  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>If you have recently bought a new house, you’d know how significant of an investment it is. For many people (especially considering the extremely high inflation rates), buying a house is a once-in-a-lifetime ordeal. It makes sense when people want to make all the right choices in decorating to make their homes look good. However, home décor, paint jobs, furniture, and fixtures are quite daunting, to say the least.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there is no written rule about it that you can go wrong – there are certain things that you’d like them a certain way, and there would be a different way it would appeal to the masses. That’s when things become confusing, and choices huddled up. However, we recommend finding a middle ground if you aren’t too adventurous or bold about your choices, and you can still go ahead with adding personalized touches to your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Master Bedroom Makeover</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we talk about master bedrooms, people tend to shy away from adding more to them because they naturally want to, but they are afraid if it will appeal to the onlooker. We say let it be because it is your master bedroom, and if you have bought the house (instead of renting), you have nothing to worry about and would be seeing the bedroom more often than anybody else. Let&#8217;s put on your creative hats, and let’s get started on your master bedroom makeover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Accent Paint Job</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that nothing too crazy is desirable here. As a result, we recommend adding a bit of personality to your master bedroom without doing something unusual – an accent paint job. Accent paint is an amazing way to revamp any space and add dimension and personality to it, all in a very acceptable and safe manner. All you must do is choose a color for all the furniture, fixtures, trimmings, and edges and keep the background neutral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Contrasting Solids</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accent paint automatically means contrasting solids. That’s why for instance, you can choose black accent paint to color your windows and door trimmings, add a black ceiling fan, curtain rods, and other minimalist features in that striking color while the contrasting background remains solid. It truly makes your room look spacious and allows you to add fixtures of contrasting color while it all binds together beautifully with a neutral background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Color Choices</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people go for a darker accent paint and a lighter background because it makes the room look spacious with a lot more dimension to it. You can very easily swap the two-color choices and go from a darker background with lighter accents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this will only work if you happen to have a huge master bedroom that doesn’t seem to feel conjoined in one go. It can also work for nurseries or kid’s rooms with little to no furniture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you choose to work on for your master bedroom makeover, one thing is for sure. We would still recommend for you to go for whatever YOU WANT. It is your house, and nothing can go wrong unless it doesn’t appeal to you. You don’t have to impress anybody or work your way around for things to be acceptable to family or friends. Nobody but you is paying all those bills, so make sure that your home suits your own taste.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_2  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>When you’re renting out living space, you don’t have too much freedom when it comes to making the place your own and adding your own creative design and décor elements. With the rent you end up paying every month, there’s hardly enough money in the budget to spend on new furniture and other décor. We recommend some of the best tips on how you can make your rented living and dining room budget rental-friendly while still incorporating personal and cohesive design elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Repaint The Walls</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most rent agreements allow you to paint the walls as long as you paint them back to their original color when you eventually move out. So, this means you can go crazy with the color palette!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can go for dark and moody tones or light and airy ones, depending on the mood you want to create. You can even try out accent walls, colored guidelines, or painted murals if you want to go for something a little more unique or out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Add Personalized Artworks</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing screams rental like general prints and paintings of landscapes. If you want to add a personal and homey touch to your rented living space, go for personalized art. If you have postcards, ticket stubs, or old and sentimentally valuable records, frame them and hang them up!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most landlords will allow you to put nails in the walls as long as you remove them later and fill up the holes. Even if you can’t hang up art, you can place it on shelves, along the walls on the floor, and even lean on various tables and furniture pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Thrift Your Furniture</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While getting custom furniture made for yourself is the ultimate dream, you may want to hold off on that until you have a place of your own and not a rented space. It would be a better idea to get your furniture customized to a space you own rather than one you will need to move out of after however many months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not to mention, custom-made furniture can be super expensive and not budget-friendly. Instead, you need to thrift, thrift, thrift! Don’t be afraid to find mismatched pieces that suit your personality. Remember, you can always bring out the spray paint and practice your upholstery skills in order to make thrift furniture pieces work well together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Tie The Whole Space Together With Repeated Design Elements</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in a rented apartment or house, you want the living and dining rooms to look similar and cohesive. You can do this by repeating certain design elements. For example, you can choose the same or similar paint colors in both rooms. You can also repeat fabric, such as using the same fabric to upholster the living room sofa cushions and the dining table chairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try out some of the ideas we’ve mentioned above, and we’re sure you’ll be able to make your rented space feel a lot more like home without upsetting the landlord or straining your budget!</p></div>

		<title>Trends To Try For Decorating With Neutral Colors</title>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_3">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_3  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>There’s an air of sophistication in neutral-colored rooms and decor. However, nailing a room decor while following a neutral color palette isn’t a piece of cake. The room could look austere and dull with no warmth or comfort that one seeks from home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many make the mistake of only playing on a single-color scheme or shade. Getting a neutral room design isn’t about monotony: it’s about subtlety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Making a neutral color palette work for any room in your home only requires following some tips and tricks. We suggest some helpful tips to help you achieve the look you’re opting for and break the monotony of neutrals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Architectural Design Elements</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start with a trick that requires you to do nothing on the design side but observe. Look for architectural designs and patterns already in the room that could work harmoniously with your chosen neutral color palette. Maybe it’s the chimney made with neutral-colored bricks, or perhaps the arched entrance could work well with the look you’re seeking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Play Around With Texture</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We haven’t yet started discussing mixing and matching colors because colors may fall into place independently when you know how to play around with texture. Add a woven art piece against a textured wall or adorn the space with a wooden dining table and chairs on a carpeted floor. The possibilities are endless but don’t overdo them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Mix Different Neutrals</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neutral-toned rooms don’t have to follow a single color scheme. You can mix the beiges with browns or go for black furniture juxtaposed against white accent walls. Whichever color scheme you choose, ensure that you play around with different accents to add dimension to the space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Add Subtle Color</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a living space with neutral-colored walls doesn’t mean that adding color is a sin. Adding subtle hues to your overall neutral space breaks the monotony and adds depth for the onlookers. The aesthetic appeal the color brings makes the room livelier and subtlety is the key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Add Metallics</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re seeking to jazz up the neutral-toned space, look for pieces of furniture that introduce metallics to aesthetics. The metallics, paired with black, could impart dimension to the area and give the onlookers details to focus their eyes on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Jazz A Room Up With Wooden Furniture</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we’re discussing furniture, if metallics aren’t your style, we’re sure wooden is. But the trick here is to mix and match the tones of wooden design elements to break the monotony while adding pieces of interest to the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Play Around With Silhouettes</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, you can light up the space with different shapes and silhouettes when playing around with furniture. Have a round couch with a cuboidal closet and small vases that are cylindrical. You can also play with statement pieces and find shapes that break the monotonous look of the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Wrap Up</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the seven tips and tricks to make your neutral space vivid without compromising the sophisticated look you’re going for. Since neutrals can be played with different color schemes, mixing and matching the shades would add dimension instead of taking away the appeal. Keep experimenting, and you’ll find a balance that works for your space. Happy designing!</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Playing around with dark colors can be the best creations of all time or be a total failure. However, you don&#8217;t need to be scared to decorate a dark-themed room, as we have gathered the most helpful and thoughtful tips that you can adopt to generate masterpieces through your creation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>The Walls Seem Like A Good Idea</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t decide where to add dark colors? Try the empty walls! Dark-toned walls make your area look highly furnished and flawlessly finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dark-themed walls also can hide built-in bumps and imperfections on the surface. However, it is not necessary to paint it all; you can go for a dark accent wall or alternative painting; it will make everything look better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Using More Than One Shade</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try two methods that will surely give a fantastic result. Select an entire color palette of one shade or try a combination of different dark tones and tints within the same space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if you have selected a grey pallet, paint the walls in a lighter tone, and place dark furniture and accessories. The curtains and vases of extreme lighter versions give an illusion of white; it even sounds exotic!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Having Trouble With Extreme Bright Spaces?</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an area in your home bothers you due to its bright appearance or exposure to light, tone it down with a dark pop. Paint the whole area with a dark color and pair it with a soft light. Or place dark-colored upholstery to mute the overall vibrance of the space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Have Fun With Dark Furnishing</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a big fan of dark-colored walls? Switch to dark upholstery instead! A wide range of options, such as curtains, furniture, accessories, cushions, stools, lampshades, vases, and sceneries, can change the game. All you have to do is be mindful of the area&#8217;s capacity and the overall theme you want to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Don&#8217;t End Up Making Everything Gloomy</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is understandable to fall in with every dark-colored article, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that all the decorations must be the same. It makes your space look monotonous and boring. For instance, if your walls and furniture are of dark tones, ensure that other accessories, such as curtains and rugs, are of comparatively lighter shades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Always Make The Ceiling and Floor Bright</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avoid one mistake at all costs; do not paint the ceiling or decorate the floor with dark color, making the space claustrophobic and as if it is falling on your head. Bright or crisp white ceilings enhance the room&#8217;s vibe, whereas the floor can be decorated with a dark rug instead!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Ending on a Darker Note</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No wonder dark colors are exciting and can make everything look interesting; being clever with the placement of the shade can change the whole game! Paint the walls, place stylish sofas, match the curtains, throw in a rug, and add as many accessories as you like following the dark theme. We hope this blog will ideally help you decorate with dark colors.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_5">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_5  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>When designing rooms, the color palette is one of the most complex aspects to nail. The room looks cheap and messy when it’s overdone with a bunch of non-contrasting shades. However, when done right, the color palette can beautify the space while adding chicness to the look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the color palette of the details doesn’t work, even the most expensive rug will look like a mess. Though tricky, designing a room by nailing the color palette is doable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some of the most common color palette mistakes people make and steps to get it right to instantly transform the air in your space and make your place look trendy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Overdone Bold Color Palette</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you will find numerous articles on the website that encourage you to mix and match bold colors. However, in design, there’s an aspect of balance or “the sweet spot” one must know how to nail to attract the onlooker with a shade or two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the bold colors aren’t ideally grounded with a stand-out piece and are instead scattered all around the room. The colors lose their appeal and end up looking like a painter’s apron mess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>No Variation</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Variation is the aspect of design that keeps the onlooker going from one piece to the other while taking their sweet time to take in all of the visual aspects that appeal to the eyes. Apart from that, it adds depth and dimension to the design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going with the same shade for all of the wooden furniture or maybe overdoing the use of velvet with no other cloth texture is what strips away the interest. Variation can also be assessed by looking at the colors. Avoid the mixing and matching of dark and light shades or using a single shade across the room like furniture and art pieces, which won’t create a balance; they’d make it dull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Neutral Failure</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous enthusiasts struggle with nailing neutrals, thinking that going monotonous will give their space sophistication when the monochromatic style is what they must opt for. What’s the difference between the two? As previously discussed, variation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire room filled with a single shade of brown would end up looking so plain that you may want to close your eyes. Flat. That’s the word one wants to avoid but is likely to keep hearing if they fail to nail neutrals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Steps To Get The Color Palette Right</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you’re guilty of making any of the above mistakes. But actual knowledge comes with experience. Hence, follow the steps given below the next time you’re designing using a tough color scheme and add liveliness to the space:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research and save any ideas that appeal to you. Then go through all the ideas, preferably across the same plane, to see the consistencies within your choice. Which style element that’s common in all the ideas you’ve saved appeals to you? Draw them out because they’ll be your signature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look for the colors you’ve mostly chosen and try to find the perfect combinations you can make using those colors to give the space a specific feeling. You can consult some color psychology tricks to nail this step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have 3-5 colors you want to accommodate, look for particular design pieces with the same color scheme, such as an art piece or a Persian rug. You can also look for pieces based on the anchor color.</p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have these elements picked out, narrow your options and choose only one to two items that work well to be signature pieces, matching the color you’re going for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Step 5:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the remaining colors for small items around the room. An artistic vase or upholstered cushions could work well to bring a pop of color to the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have all these decor items, move things around and look for the sweet spot for a harmonious look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Final Thoughts</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nailing a color palette can be tricky, but the step is crucial in your design process as it can make or break the look you’re going for. Once you have experimented enough, your eyes will be trained to acknowledge the items that don’t work and how you can fix them. Hope these steps help, but there’s only one way to know: designing.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>No house is complete without a dining area; it is a place that makes mealtime more special and brings positive energy to your home. It also serves as a place that gives families a chance to bond away from their hectic schedules. If you have a small dining area or one that is in the corner of your kitchen, you can still take some smart steps to make it look cozy and comfortable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Install a Bench</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to maximize the seating area in a small dining room, the best way is to build a floating upholstered bench hugging the wall. The installed bench will instantly make your space appear less cluttered and cozy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can add a small and stylish dining table in the center to make the perfect dining space. Experiment with color and use bright hues for the upholstery to add life to the dining area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Add an Antique Rug to Anchor Your Dining Table</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding a rug is the perfect way to anchor your dining table and add an element of coziness, texture, and pattern to your space. Additionally, rugs also make the space appear larger. You can either use a vintage rug or rugs with bright, colorful hues to transform your space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Try a Round Dining Table Set Up</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A round table is perfect for squeezing in more people in a small space. It is compact and allows you to increase the number of chairs, unlike traditional rectangular tables where you lose seating space at corners. Another plus point of having a round table is that it makes it easier for people to have conversations across the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Add Floating Shelves</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding floating shelves to your space is the easiest and cheapest way to increase storage space for placing dishes, glassware, cutlery, and other dining room essentials. The best part is that these things won&#8217;t be utilizing any of your floor space. If you have some experience with woodworking, floating shelves make for an easy and fun project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Hang Wallpaper</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make the walls of your dining area pop with textured wallpaper, adding dimension to the walls and helping them seem bigger than they are. You can use neutral tones for tiny spaces to give a spacious look. If you want to go bold, you can add peppy wallpaper print to make the tiny space stand out. However, this is only recommended when your table is away from your living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Use a Drop-Leaf Table</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A drop-leaf table&#8217;s primary purpose is to spare some space when the table is not being used. These tables are ideal for smaller spaces going to their extendable flexibility. When you don&#8217;t need it, you can simply put the leaf of your dining table up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Add a Large Mirror</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since mirrors reflect both artificial and natural light, they are ideal for small spaces to make a room brighter during the day and night. Whether you decide to go for a traditional mirror or a vintage one, you can&#8217;t really go wrong since all the options available in the market are amazing.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Time to add a hint of a tasteful color scheme, just like the pinch of seasoning over food! Kitchen interiors are now shifting from simple to stylish, for which adding an eye-catching color theme is a must. Let&#8217;s take a look at some fun ideas for an instant kitchen makeover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Splash In Some Exciting Colors</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your kitchen color pallet depends on the size and capacity of the room. Usually, small areas look more open and spacious with comparatively light and soft colors and vice versa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>For Small Areas</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pastels (pastel green, blue, pink, grey, mint, Persian).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creams (coffee, barley, tumbleweed, beige).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light shades of each color.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>For Sizeable Areas</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dark shades (black, teal, dark blue, dark green, purple).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vibrant colors (orange, yellow, green, blue).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to experiment with something else, try picking suitable wallpaper. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be something related to edibles; you can try other patterns that will give a unique touch to the walls, such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tiny floral</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leafy designs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstract</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geometrical shapes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>How About Some Painted Furniture?</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let go of the dull cabinets and stools in your comfortable space and throw in vibrant furniture that combines your walls. For instance, if you have painted the walls in mint green, you can try a dark woody shade for the cabinets to give them a bohemian touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>A Suitable Lampshade Is an Ultimate Finesse</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have decided on the theme you wish to inaugurate, it becomes easy to select lampshades and other light accessories. After all, adequate light holds grave importance in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the example of a bohemian kitchen, basket pendant lights will provide an elegant finish to the room. For an American-style, eglo lights seem to endure the job perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Decorate the Empty Windows</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While refurnishing everything, don&#8217;t miss out on the windows! Hang small and cute scenic painting tiles adjacent to the sides of the windows; three on each panel will do the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can even hang minimal curtains of sheer fabric to give a diffused sunlight effect to your kitchen. Make sure your windows are spotless each time, as dirty windows might bring down the style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Switch The Tablescape</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is high time to change the old tablescape and commit to a newer one. Pick one color from your color pallet that complements the aesthetic of your theme. For instance, following the bohemian theme, pick sheer whites or cream colors that will complement the wood and the mint walls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Mini Plant Potters</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plants add life to everything! Pick some fresh cacti or low-maintenance indoor plants and place them beside the window or the washing sink. It will automatically enhance the freshness and mood of the room!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Ending on a Fun Tone</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always fun to keep experimenting with themes and colors, and if you like something, don&#8217;t be afraid to try it out once! We hope this blog will help you add color to the kitchen in fun ways! Have you picked a color theme yet?</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_8">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_8  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Are you planning on redecorating your home? Do keep an eye out for the trends that are fading. It is ideal to take a good look at your home decor once in a while and see what is worth keeping and what needs to go, and with a heavy heart, you need to get with the times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing about trends is that most of them are outdated or overdone. While some might have become timeless, some die as the years pass. Here are some of the most outdated home trends 2023 that you need to be done with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Mass Produced Anything</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals are looking to have a more soulful space in their homes so that they can feel more like themselves at home. Thus, Pinterest searches on vintage, and electric interior design are shooting up by a significant amount. These artworks focus on telling a story rather than just being meaningless pieces. It’s time to say hello to vintage treasures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Animal Prints</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only are we saying goodbye to commonly produced artwork, but we are bidding off all animal-printed things. Instead, we are bringing in more colored, happier tones to positively impact our minds. If you still have that Zebra rug or a cheetah print in your home, it&#8217;s time to get it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>All Whites &amp; Grays</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can say goodbye to white and gray kitchens in 2023; they are leaving. Instead, individuals are moving towards brighter-colored kitchen combinations. Since your home is where you spend most of your time, colors greatly impact how you feel, and whites and grays tend to give off a dull feel, thus the change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Rose &amp; Gold Hardware</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, rose gold and gold anything was a super must-have in the yesteryears. However, it is time to let it go. It&#8217;s been overdone and is a common find in every other household. Instead, you can install a silver set of shiny drawer pulls or add a pop of color by choosing any other that fits the theme of your house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Carpeted Bathrooms</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While bathrooms have long been carpeted in previous years, now that you think about it, it seems rather illogical. It is not the best area to place a carpet. If there is ever a water damage situation in the washroom, think of the damage it will cause you. And not to mention the mess. This trend needs to be cut short and be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Anything Terrazzo</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terrazzo unrestrained is not completely out, but it still gives a very old-fashioned look to your home. Thus, there is no need to overuse it in the home. It must be gone if you have walls or floors covered. It gives the home a vintage vibe that is no longer appreciated. There is no denying that it was widely popular in the 90s. However, it’s time to replace it with a fresh set of marble of your choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Word Art</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the giant family hung on the front porch and in the kitchen necessary? You can do without it, right? Generic phrases like these have lost their charm, and you can find a much more attractive wall hanging with a family picture. It will be so much more aesthetically pleasing than the word art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Final Verdict</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This list of the most outdated home decor styles and outdated home trends 2023 will give you a good idea of what needs to go out of your home decor straightaway. Implement these and watch how your home transforms.</p></div>
