										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="et_pb_section et_pb_section_0 et_section_regular" >
				
				
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_0">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_0  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_0  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>There&#8217;s something so refreshing about wearing colors that look good on you, and spring is the perfect time to experiment. Whether you&#8217;re starting fresh with a new look or want to add some new shades to your existing closet, here are some of our favorite spring color combinations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>1. Royal Blue &amp; Peach</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Royal blue and peach are a classic combination that can be used in many ways. You can use a light blue and a peach or a darker shade of royal blue with the same color as a peach. You could also go for something even bolder by pairing dark royal blue with dark peach or light royal blue with light peaches. The possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>2. Red &amp; Yellow</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Red and yellow are two complementary colors that contrast each other. This means they look great when paired but can clash if you&#8217;re not careful. Red is very warm, while yellow is very bright and eye-catching. These traits make them ideal for spring fashion because they add excitement to your wardrobe without being too bold or distracting from the rest of your outfit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to wear red and yellow together is by mixing them with neutrals like black or grey (which will help minimize potential clashes). You could also try pairing one piece each in this combination with another item in your wardrobe&#8211;like wearing a denim jacket with red jeans instead of black ones&#8211;to create a more subtle look!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>3. Hot Pink &amp; Cyan</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hot pink and cyan are two bright, vivid colors that complement each other nicely. These two hues are great for spring because they&#8217;ll give your outfit a pop of color without being too overwhelming or in your face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can wear these complementary colors together by pairing a hot pink top with a cyan skirt or shorts, or you could even wear both shades on opposite ends of the spectrum (like an all-pink ensemble with some blue accessories). The possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>4. Light Purple, Mint, &amp; Butter</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Light purple, mint, and butter are all spring colors. Combining these three hues will create a soft and soothing look that can be used as a background or accent color on walls in the home or clothing items in fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Light purple is the main color, while mint and butter are used as accents to make this look interesting without being overwhelming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>5. Pastel Orange, Peach, &amp; Custard</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re drawn to the boldness of orange, but don&#8217;t want to go full force with it, try pairing your favorite shade with peach or custard. These muted shades are soft and feminine&#8211;they&#8217;ll give your look just enough pop without being overpowering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more contrast in your spring wardrobe, consider using pastel orange as an accent color instead of letting it be the focus piece in your outfit. The best way to do this is by pairing it with another pastel tone (like peach) or a muted yellow (like custard). This creates a balance between soft hues that complement each other beautifully without competing for attention!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for some inspiration for your next project, we hope these color combinations have given you some ideas. We know there are so many more possibilities out there, and we can&#8217;t wait to see what you come up with! Happy springtime, everyone!</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_1">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_1  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Your kitchen is one of your home’s most high-traffic and used areas. You use it daily to make breakfast, snacks, lunch, and dinner. It gets messy and unorganized, especially when used in a rush.  </p>
<p>If you are looking for tips to organize your kitchen cabinets, you’re at the right place. These are some simple and practice tips!  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Remove Everything and De-clutter</b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start by removing everything from the kitchen cabinets. This step may seem overwhelming, but it is the most effective way to sort things out. Lay everything out, check expiry dates, and assess what you need and don’t require.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep a trash can nearby so you can throw away expired items. Moreover, you can separately place things you want to donate or sell in a box.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Line Your Cabinets</b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you’ve thoroughly cleaned your cabinets, add liners to make them look neat. Liners also help eliminate odors and are easy to clean.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Place Similar Items Together </b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, categorize your items and store similar things together. For example, you can place all the baking items in one cabinet, and the herbs and spices can be grouped in another. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Place Heavy Items on the Lower Shelves </b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another tip is to store heavy kitchen items like pots and pans in the lower cabinets and store light-weight items like pot lids and spices in the upper cabinets. Doing so will make things easily accessible to you.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Utilize Vertical Space </b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the vertical space in your kitchen cabinets to place cookie sheets, baking paper rolls, and aluminum foil rolls to make them easily accessible.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><b>Use Drawer Organizers or Dividers </b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to organize your kitchen drawers is to insert drawer dividers. These dividers eliminate the need to search your drawers for things you frequently require and help keep everything organized.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Hang Items Using Adhesive Hooks and Pegboards</b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use the space outside of your kitchen cabinets to hang kitchen appliances like cutting boards, cutlery, and more using adhesive hooks and pegboards.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Use Airtight Containers</b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another great organizing tip is to use airtight containers to store food items instead of placing them in their wrappers. You can use them to store cookies, pasta, and more. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Maintain Your Kitchen Cabinets </b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, after organizing your kitchen cabinets, it is essential to maintain them so they stay that way. Add labels so that everyone knows where to place the items. Also, ensure everything is in its place before leaving the kitchen.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Final Word</b> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have organized kitchen cabinets, you are less likely to make a mess, and it also makes cooking simple and hassle-free. Follow these organization tips to keep your kitchen cabinets organized.  </p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="et_pb_section et_pb_section_2 et_section_regular" >
				
				
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_2">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_2  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Make the most of your space by utilizing your walls for organization stations that don’t take up a lot of space with a couple of options that are best suited for your space. You can use this as inspiration for your next DIY projects and learn about a couple of styles for wall organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’d like an adjustable wall organization system, you might want to consider using a pegboard organizing system. The pegboards are lightweight and durable to hold everything you need that is also adjustable to best suit your needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pegboards can be used for your office, personal crafting area, kid’s crafting or playroom, and a shelving display. There is the traditional pegboard that you can customize using some paint to match your wall or color story. Another option is a more minimalist, modern pegboard made from wood with a neutral color that is complementary to many colors and home décor themes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One simple organization wall feature is hanging decorative clipboards that can be used for organization or keepsakes. You can have one clipboard featuring your work calendar and another featuring fun photos for decoration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use this in your office to organize documents, mail, and other important work documents. To hang the clipboards, you can use small Command hooks that are easy to apply and remove without damaging your walls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the classic versatile wall organizers is a simple corkboard that you can customize using paint or applying your favorite fabrics of choice. You can use this to either organize documents in your office or can be used to store your accessories that are easy to reach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can take small gift bags and pin them to the board then store your accessories such as hair accessories or sunglasses in one place. You can also buy tacks with hooks to hand your jewelry such as necklaces and earrings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having an organizing unit by the front door will help you keep track of everything that you can drop off at the door using wooden boxes and some hooks. This is an easy DIY project that only requires wooden boxes, a piece of scrap wood (for wooden backing), hooks, screws, and a screwdriver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When finding wooden boxes, try to get some that can fit mail envelopes and a bigger one to fit folders. At the home improvement store, you can get a premeasured piece of wood (or buy a scrap piece and cut your own at home), heavy-duty hanging hooks, and screws. Line up the larger wooden box on the wood backing with the upper right corner, check for level, and screw it into place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Line up the smaller boxes with the top being level with the top of the bigger box and line up the second smaller box even to the bottom of the bigger box, check with level, then screw boxes into wooden backing. On the bottom portion measure to evenly separate hanging hooks, check for level, mark for screw placement, and screw into the wooden backing. Mount by your front door to use for keeping bags, coats, keys, mail, and more.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_3">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_3  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Do you ever feel like the dull monotony of life is translating into your home? Are you tired of plain white walls and underwhelming spaces? Maybe now is the time to consider bold and flashy design when it comes to home décor and styling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of people think that small spaces need to be kept simple for fear of making a space overwhelming or claustrophobic. There is also a sense of hesitancy in making a bold decision because what if you realize that you don’t like what you’ve picked or change your mind about it later?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re here to let you know that you shouldn’t be afraid of making a bold choice! If you end up with something you don’t like, you can probably change it later. You may also even surprise yourself by stepping out of your comfort zone and choosing a more daring design aspect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re still a bit unsure, you can start with a small space in your room, such as a closet! These are some ways in which you can incorporate big and bold design aspects into a small space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Move Away From Plain Walls</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plain white walls are a thing of the past as far as we’re concerned. Wallpaper is making strides this year, and you have an incredible array of styles and prints to choose from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wallpaper is also a very simple and easy way to incorporate a theme into your closet if you want to. If you’re not too fond of wallpaper, consider a dark or bold shade of paint and add art and custom prints to break up the monotony of your walls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Choose A Statement Piece</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A small space such as a closet cannot be filled with too many clashing pieces of art or furniture. It would be best if you chose one statement piece and modeled the rest of the space around that. In the case of a closet, consider an ornate mirror or a dresser to be your statement piece. Your choice should also add function to your room since it is already a small space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Don’t Shy Away From The Details</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As they say, the devil is in the details. The way to take a regular boring space and transform it into a space that is bold, daring, and stylistically advanced is to pay special attention to the details. If you end up choosing wallpaper for the closet, you can paint the trim and sidings in the space to match with an accent color in the wallpaper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have built-in shelves, consider adding wallpaper inside the shelves as well as on the walls. Another small detail that goes a long way is matching all the hardware, such as the light fixtures and door handles, and knobs, so that they are all in the same metal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line is that even if you have a very small space to work with, you can, and you should incorporate different and bold style aspects in that space. Try out some of the ideas we have mentioned and see how much you can transform your closet from dull and boring to bold and daring.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="et_pb_section et_pb_section_4 et_section_regular" >
				
				
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_4">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_4  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Are you thinking of upgrading your home or doing a few renovations? If yes, you&#8217;ll need to figure out how you will finance this project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there are several different options to consider, each comes with its own pros and cons. Here are 4 options for financing home improvements to help you choose which one is the right fit for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>1. Paying Out-of-Pocket</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your first option is saving up some money and paying out-of-pocket for home improvements. This option is great because you don’t have to borrow any money and can avoid repaying that amount with interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, saving up enough money to pay for renovations with cash can take a long time. Not to mention, you have to consider that the cash could have been used for other expenses instead or been put into your savings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>2. Tapping Into Home Equity</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re trying to renovate your home, borrowing against the home’s equity makes sense. There are a few different ways of going about tapping into home equity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can take out a cash-out refinance loan, a home equity loan, or a line of credit. The first option would affect your mortgage, whereas the other two wouldn’t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home equity loans generally have lower interest, but you need to keep in mind that you run the risk of losing your home if you&#8217;re unable to make timely payments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>3. Taking Out A Loan</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A personal loan can be a lot easier to deal with than a home equity loan. Once it gets approved, the process moves much faster, and you can also try to avoid having to pay high closing costs. In the case of an unsecured loan, there is no risk of you losing your house. However, a personal loan will come with a much higher interest rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>4. Using Your Credit Card</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your last option to finance your home improvements is using your credit card. Certain cards can offer you an interest-free period when repaying the money can be made easier for you. Additionally, spending such large amounts on your credit card can earn you a number of benefits, like credit card points, air miles, or cash-back options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only downside to consider is that you will have to be very strict with repayment if you want to avoid high-interest rates. You may also be unable to get a line of credit that is large enough to finance all of the renovations you were thinking of making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these options we have talked about can be good choices for financing your home improvement. However, since each option comes with its own pros and cons, it would be worth your while to consider each option in depth before choosing which one is a good fit for you.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="et_pb_section et_pb_section_5 et_section_regular" >
				
				
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_5">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_5  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>We know how difficult it can be to keep a bathroom clean, tidy, and organized. It seems as if just getting ready for the day in the mornings can leave the bathroom looking and feeling like a complete mess afterward. So, what can you do to make the bathroom organization really stick?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a few bathroom organization tips outlined for you below that will ensure that your bathroom stays neat and tidy and that everything has its own place. With these organization tips, even the smallest of bathrooms can feel spacious and open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Use Drawer Dividers</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re sick of your bathroom vanity being strewn with makeup and other bathroom products, drawer dividers can be your saving grace. These dividers can ensure that everything stays in its place and help you make the most of your drawer space. If you don’t want to go out and buy drawer dividers, you can also use trays and boxes from around the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Uniform Bottles</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider buying uniform bottles to fill your products like shampoos, conditioners, and body wash. These bottles take up less space on your shelves as compared to bottles and containers of different sizes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottles can also help the space look cleaner and neater. While you’re at it, you can also print out custom labels so that none of your products get mixed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Towel Bars or Hooks on the Bathroom Door</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many bathrooms don&#8217;t have much wall space for towel bars, meaning that towels get strewn along other surfaces like the shower rail or along the side of the tub. This makes the whole bathroom look messy and leads to damp towels that don&#8217;t dry evenly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the most of the little wall space available, you can put up some towel bars or hooks on the bathroom door. This is a great way to use up space that would otherwise be left empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Vertical Storage Shelves Above the Toilet</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another underutilized space in the bathroom that can be used is the wall space above the toilet. Most people prefer to keep a few extra rolls of toilet paper on the toilet flush and hang up a painting or a sign on the wall above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you put up vertical storage shelves above the toilet instead, however, you would be able to store a lot more than just a few rolls of toilet paper there. These shelves can be a great spot for bathroom cleaning supplies, a small potted plant, folded fresh towels, or anything else that needs a place to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these bathroom organization tips that we have outlined, and we&#8217;re sure that your bathroom will look a lot neater and cleaner and that it&#8217;ll be easier to ensure that everything stays in its place.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Whether you live in a noisy part of town near the main road or a train station, or you have noisy upstairs neighbors, there can be several reasons you might want to soundproof your home. Soundproofing can be great in keeping unwanted sounds out of your house or even keeping sounds from your house going outside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain rooms in your house may require more soundproofing than others. For example, a nursery, a home office, or maybe a game room would require more soundproofing than a regular sitting room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a few things you can try if you&#8217;re looking to soundproof your home but do not want to remove drywall or undergo extensive renovations. This is how to soundproof your house easily and effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Retrofitting Drywall</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great way to soundproof a room is by retrofitting the drywall. This means you can attach another layer of thin drywall to the existing drywall in your room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By doing this, you can avoid removing old drywall, which can be a hassle and might require professional help, and simply DIY and add on a new layer. The additional layer of drywall will prevent sounds from the outside from entering your room and prevent sounds from inside the room from overflowing outside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Hanging Up Heavy Curtains or Drapes</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have blinds or flight, flowing curtains in your house, consider replacing them with thicker, heavier curtains or drapes. Not only will they offer you more privacy and help in keeping your rooms dark, but they can also help with sound dampening purposes. Windows are often the entry point for unwanted noise, and curtains can be a cheap and effective way to block off that entry point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Placing Area Rugs</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have noisy downstairs neighbors or hardwood or marble floors that make sounds echo around the house, area rugs can be a great soundproofing tool. Area rugs can add comfort and style to your house while also acting as an absorbent for unwanted sounds. They can prevent sound from reflecting and bouncing around your rooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Hanging Acoustic Panels Or Soundproofing Foam</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acoustic panels are a great way to soundproof any room and are relatively simple and easy to install. They can also be found in various sizes and colors to match your décor and the general theme of your rooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then only downfall is the problem of cost. Acoustic panels can be quite expensive, but you might find that they are worth the cost with how effective they are and because you can avoid having to undergo major renovations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cheaper alternative to acoustic panels is soundproofing foam. This foam can be easily found on sites like Amazon and is available in different sizes, shapes, and colors, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are various reasons for wanting to soundproof your house or even just specific rooms. If you’re living in an older house or maybe one that has recently been renovated, chances are you’re not willing to do any more renovation. Try out the various soundproofing methods we have mentioned above to soundproof your house quickly and without too much hassle.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>When it comes to choosing the best flooring materials for your bathroom, most homeowners think along the lines of how it will look. The critical difference between bathroom flooring and other rooms is that you need waterproof flooring in the bathroom. While that is a significant factor to consider, the durability of the flooring should be the top priority unless you wish to change the flooring often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Porcelain And Ceramic Tile</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best option for bathroom flooring is tile. There are numerous shapes, sizes, colors, and textures available in the market, and you can pick what you most like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Porcelain and ceramic tiles are the ideal options. Not only are they waterproof, but these give a polished and expensive look to the bathroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Natural Stone</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Natural stone is also one of the best options for bathroom flooring – it is highly durable and attractive. The stones will give a refined look to the washroom and make it look like you’ve significantly invested in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part is that it is entirely waterproof and inexpensive. If you’re thinking from a long-term perspective, natural stone tiles are an excellent way to elevate the resale value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Vinyl</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vinyl has gained immense popularity in the past few years as a great bathroom flooring option. Not only is it waterproof, but highly economical and easy to install. It is available as tiles, sheets, or planks in the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two types – wood and stone; however, both are equally functional. Even though it won’t impact the resale value, it undoubtedly keeps your bathroom floor looking great through the years to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Concrete</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concrete bathroom floors are present in the home where there are slab foundations. This concrete flooring can be painted, polished, or stamped to match the aesthetic of your home. The benefit of this flooring is that it keeps your bathroom flooring away from water damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will last you years and is one of the most cost-effective options. One drawback of concrete flooring is that it can become even more challenging and colder for homeowners to adjust to in winter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Fixed Wood</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Water and wood are not a good match, but this engineered wood includes a water-resistant plywood base. Wood is your best bet if you wish to give your little cottage a warm and cozy flooring look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is prone to damage and is a relatively pricier option. One other type of wood to look at is solid hardwood. However, wood is the last option you should consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whichever material you choose, ensure that bathroom flooring is waterproof. Your bathroom is the most high-moisture environment in the house, so it needs to be highly durable.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>If you&#8217;re redecorating some of the rooms in your house, you may want to think about taking your wall décor to the next level beyond just paint and wallpaper. A fun new option for you to try is wall stenciling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple technique can elevate any room and offer you something fun and exciting to try. Wall stenciling is also a very easy process, so if you’re new to it and just starting out, you don’t need to stress and worry about things going wrong. Let’s take a quick look at everything you need to know about wall stenciling to ensure that your stenciling project turns out great:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Don’t Cheap Out On The Quality Of The Stencils</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quality of the stencils you use will play a huge role in how your walls turn out. Our number one piece of advice is to get high-quality stencils. The stencils should be thick, flexible, and large enough to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning on making a repetitive pattern, the stencils should have a repeating image in one corner to help you get the placement right. Stencils can cost anywhere between $10 to $50, depending on which company you buy from. Don&#8217;t risk saving a few dollars if it ends up with a badly stenciled wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Ensure That Your Stencils Are Stuck To The Wall Securely To Avoid Bleeding</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you’re a seasoned pro, simply holding the stencils to the wall while you paint isn’t the best idea. Your hand could slip, you may need to re-dip your paintbrush, or the paint may bleed onto the wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, stick your stencil securely to the wall before you start painting. While most people use tape, you can also try a spray adhesive. Spray adhesive can leave a sticky residue on the walls, but you can wipe that off with a simple cleaning the next day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Choose A Simple And Random Pattern For Your First Time</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wall stencils come in all kinds of patterns. Some patterns are repetitive and linear, meaning that the stencil placement needs to be perfectly lined up to get the pattern right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be difficult for a beginner to do, especially if some of the walls in your house or the floor level isn’t exactly straightforward. We suggest starting with a random stencil pattern to avoid this trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>A Little Bit Of Paint Goes A Long Way</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our last piece of advice for stenciling beginners is to use a very little bit of paint when painting over the stencils. Load some paint onto your brush, dab the brush off on some kitchen towels, and then blot it carefully onto the stencil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like, you can always go over it with a second coat of paint. Too much paint at once can lead to dripping and bleeding, which can ruin the overall look of the wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep these tips in mind when trying out wall stencils, and we’re sure that you’ll find the process super easy and end up with some amazing wall décor!</p></div>
