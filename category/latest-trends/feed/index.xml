				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Your home is your biggest investment, no matter from which generation you are or in what part of the world you reside. It is not easy to buy a house, and so once people do, they want everything about their house to stand out and look personal at the same time. From interior decoration to exterior statements, every ideation and concept has to come together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Wall Hangings</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barren walls are not only outdated but also extremely dull. However, to counter this, overly decorating your walls is also not the right way. So how to go about it? The answer lies in personalization. Interior decoration can be done haphazardly or follow a theme and look symmetrical. The choice is yours, but we would go for the latter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make things easier for you all, we have decided to share our favorite ways of decorating a wall with wall hangings. The key here is not to overdo it or create a huge cluster. Also, remember that spacing is an aesthetic. Besides all this, you are good at experiments, mix and match as you like. Let’s get started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>1. Planters</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest, most versatile wall hanging must be given to planters. You can find them in an array of colors, designs, shapes, and sizes, allowing you to choose and personalize however you want. Better yet, you get to house a plant and take care of it. However, you can always go for a fake one if you can’t trust yourself to take care of the real one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>2. Floating Shelves</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Floating shelves are the best way to upholster a platform on your otherwise flat, barren wall. Now you have a showcase to place almost anything on it decoratively. People put up picture frames, souvenirs, ornaments, and other minimalist things to give it symmetry and make it look aesthetically appealing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>3. Crocheted Accessories</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crochet is a huge trend right now. From clothing items to decorative accessories, everything crochet is big. You can only imagine the charm of a crochet wall hanging. You can choose a neutral-colored one if you want to keep it minimal and chic with just the texture. Otherwise, you can pick an accent wall for the color contrast effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>4. DIY Classics</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is mainly for all those homes with creative kids who easily get bored. A few supplies and your kid can give you a DIY classic to put up on your wall as a decoration. From mosaic to paper mache – the variety is endless, and you can keep your kid occupied for a long. The fruit of it all? a DIY wall hanging to decorate your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>5. Art &amp; More Art</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are an art lover, then just play it safe. Choose a big or multiple smaller paintings and curate a personalized wall hanging galore to soothe your eyes. Safe to say, whether the art is yours or somebody else’s, it will showcase your keen observation and take out to your visitors. Isn&#8217;t that what personalization being all about anyway?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Final Thoughts</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no written rules about wall hangings, and neither can it go wrong if your visitors don’t approve of it. However, it can add to your home’s personality or majorly take away if you don’t put thought into your motive. Hence, that is why you need to do a good job at it. We hope our shared ideas help you create a beautifully personalized wall decoration.</p></div>

		<title>Why Winter Is The Best Time Of The Year To Buy A House</title>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_2">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_2  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>It will come off as a surprise since most people are unaware of why winter is the best time to buy a house. The primary reason winter is considered the best season to buy a house is a considerable drop in home listing prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is usually because the homeowner has no money left and is desperate to sell their property. Let’s discuss this in detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Winter House Hunt</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Winter is the time for holidays when children are off from school and enjoying their winter vacations. However, for homeowners struggling financially, it is the time to sell their houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buyers who purchase a home should look at the listing prices of different properties and see the price reductions that the homeowners have done. One primary reason for reducing the prices so drastically is the property being overpriced earlier by the real estate agents or the homeowners themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The house’s price drops when the property is listed on the market for more than a month and gets no potential buyers. They keep reducing the price till the house gets sold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a buyer, you should thoroughly inspect the house to get a clear idea of how well the place holds up in the winter season. It is best to know everything before buying the property, from the leaks to the insulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Advantages of Buying a House in Winter</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The spring and summer seasons are incredibly crowded, with buyers left, right, and center and a shortage of good houses to buy. However, the housing market is slow in winter, and you might get the house of your dreams. Let’s look at the significant advantage of buying a house in winter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Low Competition</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of individuals tend to buy houses in the peak seasons. Thus, you will face no such competition when purchasing the house that you want to live in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Tax Savings</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals who end up closing on their houses before the taxes can potentially save a good amount. It is best to check the rules of your state and your taxpayer and see whether they apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Instant Closings</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the winter season is a slow time for all, real estate agents, insurance, and mortgage companies don’t have much work to handle. You can get your house in less than a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Access to the Best Movers</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard to find movers in the summer and spring due to a rise in the house-selling market, which wastes a lot of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The winter season offers some significant advantages to buying a house. Not only do you get affordable options, but sellers are highly pumped to sell their houses, and you get access to the best movers since they don’t have much work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closing times also speed up due to a lack of house sales. Even though you don’t have a wide variety of houses in the summer and spring, you can get a much better deal in winter.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_3">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_3  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>You can start decorating and furnishing your new deck in different ways. The most important thing to consider when decorating a deck is how it will be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can go as deep as you would like while decorating. You can combine different furniture and other interior options to boost comfort and visual appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create an outdoor living space that welcomes and relaxes you with some improvements. We share some decorating ideas that you can use for furnishing a new deck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Light Up The Deck</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding more lights is one of the most important things you can do to make your deck look prettier. Make sure you choose lights that are best for outdoor use. If your deck isn’t covered completely, you can use some pole vaults to ensure the lights are installed properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Add Accessories To The Deck Furniture</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The furniture you place on the deck can make a major difference. this also means that you must add accessories as you go along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can decorate your space with coffee tables, side tables, and potted plants in any way you want. To ensure that the cylinder candles don’t fall or cause fires, you must get them weighed properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Curate Some Dining Venues</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important area that requires your attention is where you will host guests. You can dedicate one of your corners to meals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also need to add furniture that you can use to serve meals and can be a place where people can eat. You can use outdoor benches rather than armchairs to have more flexibility for gathering around the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Make Sure The Chairs Are Comfortable</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chairs that you have on your deck are the ones on which you can rest for long periods. You can give this space vibrancy by using colorful pillows. You should also ensure that the pillows’ fabric can repel moisture. Comfortable chairs mean you can stay on your deck or patio for as long as you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Design Your Deck Around A Firepit</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your deck is essentially a place where you can chill. You can set up a portable fireplace and have different firepits where you can keep warm in the winter months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure your deck is not made of flammable material because that can make things even more complicated. If it is flammable, place a fire-resistant pad on the flames; it will make things more bearable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Add A Frame To Your Deck</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suppose you have a stylish panel or intricate pattern on your deck. You can decorate the deck so the frame provides privacy and style. You can make the whole frame more attached to nature by gently placing some vines or wisteria on the deck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Final Notes</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decorating your deck can be a bit challenging. However, when done correctly, the result can be satisfying. You can furnish the deck in the best way possible and end with a deck lacking aesthetically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to be smart and search for references online for inspiration. With these ideas and tips, you can envision your dream deck and bring it to life.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_4">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_4  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Some people like the warm sunshine, while others prefer the slight breeze just before the arrival of winter. Picture yourself sitting on your backyard swing with a blanket covering your lap and a book in your left hand while you sip a cup of hot chocolate from your left hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doesn’t this sound cozy? Well, that’s what a fully furnished, decorated backyard offers. You could also add a few pieces on your porch to give your house a welcoming touch. These are some must-have pieces to make the most of your outdoor space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Comfortable Seating</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing you need to place in your backyard is furniture. Creating a comfortable seating space with benches and lounge chairs will give your garden a modern look. Depending on how big your family is, you can either go with a pair of wicker chairs or a 7-seater patio set with a table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Hanging Hammock</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hanging hammock will become your cozy spot on days when you are tired and want to enjoy a drink and take a nap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>A Fire Pit</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchanging horror stories are more exciting and spooky over a fire pit. Moreover, it gives you the perfect spot to roast marshmallows. The serene glow of the fire and the sound of fireflies will have you in a trance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Propane Torches</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the best accessories that helps create the perfect mood lighting is Tonga torches. You can line the pathway to your garden or backyard with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Awnings Or Umbrellas</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might want to sit outside in summer, but the sunlight will stop you. Here, umbrellas bring the shade and cool down the place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Portable Stove</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the mood to have a BBQ outdoor? Make it on a portable stove. This handy product is lightweight and quite useful. Look for a portable stove with multiple burners and wheels so you can change its position easily. An outdoor space feels incomplete without proper seating and a BBQ pit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Server Carts</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you love hosting outdoor parties, get a stylish cart. It makes serving food and beverages a lot easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Beverage Cabinet With Fridge</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The party doesn’t start till we walk in… with beer, champagne, wine, and cocktails. The best thing about a beverage cabinet with a fridge is that not only do you get to store your alcohol for late-night parties, but you can also keep all the accessories, such as glasses, corking tools, shakers, stirrers, etc., nearby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Bench With Built-In Storage</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure your outdoor space stays uncluttered and tidy, you must have outdoor storage. What better piece of furniture than a bench with space in it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Bright Outdoor Rug</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weathered wood and stained concrete make your patio and deck look dirty, no matter how often you sweep them. So, cover the old stains with a bright rug to give the space a lively feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Decorative Accessories</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decorative accessories, such as lanterns, a multi-layered plant cart, and a green wall are just some of the accessories that spruce up your outdoor space. Choose accents you love and make sure they complement the surroundings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t let a little drizzle stop you from listening to your soothing music. A smartphone won’t give you the sound quality you want, but a Bluetooth speaker will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Decorative Throw Pillows</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend placing wicker furniture in the garden because you can place different colored cushions on it according to your mood. Don’t forget to top it with decorative throw pillows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There you have it ― the best accessories for your backyard that will turn it into a relaxing place where you can eat, play, sleep and have a good time.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_5">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_5  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>There’s nothing like the beauty of wall art that makes a house feel like home, even if you are living in a rented house. While most landlords add a clause in the lease that you are not allowed to drill, others say it’s alright, as long as you patch up the holes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you plan to decorate your seating room with wall art, make sure that your contract allows you to do it. One of the main problems to consider is minimizing damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are hanging something on the wall, you often guess the center and drill into the drywall. This guesswork results in multiple holes, and the painting is either too high or too low. The “57 Rule” of hanging wall art comes in handy in such scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Learning About The “57 Rule”</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “57 Rule” is a scientific standard that allows you to hang art at the perfect angle. The rule states that any painting or frame should be 57 inches from the ground. This height puts the artwork at eye level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using this rule to hang all your art, you create harmony and balance in your art collection. The number 57 is considered the average approximate eye height. Art in museums and galleries is displayed using this rule. Moreover, interior designers also follow it when implementing their ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might take you a while to understand the 57 Rule but consider this: It’s better to use a measuring tape to make sure your art is at a perfect height than tilted frames that make you itch to fix them! These are some simple guidelines to achieve this wall art hack.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Measuring Tape</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Painters Tape</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ball of String</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Step #1</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the measuring tape to find out how far above 57 inches is from the ground. Use a soft pencil to make a mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Step #2</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measure the height of your art and divide it by 2. If your painting is 26 inches, 26 / 2 = 13 inches. Use a soft pencil to mark the center on the back of the frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Step #3</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measure the height of the picture frame from the top and subtract it from the center of the art. For example, if the picture frame is 4 inches, 13 &#8211; 4 = 9 inches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Step #4</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add the number you got after subtracting the picture’s center and the frame’s height. The number you get is where you should install your picture frame. For example, 57 + 9 = 66 inches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Step #5</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use a monkey hook to pierce the drywall. Twist it around and push it in until the curved part is left out. You can now hang your picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure the frame is at least 8 inches from any furniture when hanging your art. The frame’s edge should be in line with the top of the furniture. You can go a little higher than 57 inches in this case, but only a few inches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There you have it ― an easy way to install wall art that looks aesthetically appealing.</p></div>

Some people only keep it limited to their personal surroundings while others go on to achieve miraculous feats doing what they love, but for others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>House Beautiful searches far and wide to find the best young designers in the country that have a mix of career orientation and personal passion fulfillment going on for them. Those are the ones truly worthy of a feature on Next Wave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>The Designers to Keep On A Lookout</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have already completed one half of this year and stride speedily but steadily into the next half, the trends of the interior designing world are changing. So if you have been on the lookout for the Next Wave designers, now is your chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Sean Leffers, Los Angeles</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One guy to nail it all – Sean Leffers, is not just an interior designer. After all, when you have been reading magazines since the age of 10, you are bound to become something of a challenge yourself. He is single-handedly responsible for bringing accents back and is not ashamed of it – neither are we.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Marie Flanigan, Houston</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where the big picture matters – Marie Flanigan is not your next-door interior designer, she is power within herself. A student only a few years back, now she looks at celebrity houses and rejects them based on the premise of not having enough creative freedom. It is safe to say it is her game, and she plays by her own rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Noz Nozawa, San Francisco</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A dedication to prosperous sustainability while designing her spaces that don’t need to be “strictly beautiful” – Now will add depth and dimension along with creating a personality for your space. If you want some of your quirks to shine through your home interiors, Noz is your gal. And you won’t have to worry about standing out from the crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>French &amp; French, Santa Fe, New Mexico</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a moment there, it felt like we were seeing doubles or hallucinating, given the stark resemblance of this Santa Fe couple to Hollywood favorite couple Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively. Now you can understand why people would gravitate towards working with them – because when the outlook is so scrumptious, the interiors are bound to be too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Clary Bosbyshell, Atlanta</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Antiques, retro, vintage – all that and more defines Clary and her style of interior decoration. You can be assured that given her will, your home would become a walk-in art gallery for your guests and may even be worth more than the property itself. Her love for antiquity gives her an edge over other contemporary designers; truth be told, that is what people sign her up for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Final Notes</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you are aware of the best new lot of interior designers in the country, you may better understand the shift in trends and what more to keep an eye out for in terms of home interiors and decoration.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>With summer around the corner, the rising temperatures will cause an increase in electricity use, energy bills for consumers at home and elsewhere. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to reduce those high electricity bills, the best thing to do is install solar panels at home. Solar panels reduce energy costs, but some can completely eliminate your bills along with more advantages of using solar power at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Help The Environment</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know that electricity comes from fossil fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas. When burned, these produce electricity, which emits harmful gases and pollutes the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a finite resource, fossil fuels prices keep fluctuating and rising. On the other hand, solar power is pure energy derived from the sun. Solar panels help combat greenhouse gas emissions, and it also reduces the dependence of human beings on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike fossil fuels, solar power does not require water to operate. This means it puts no strain on the world&#8217;s water resources. The production of solar energy is noiseless, and compared to other sources of energy, it has a minimal negative impact on the world&#8217;s environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Reliability</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The traditional power sources of electricity are non-renewable as they are expected to become depleted in the future. On the contrary, generating your own electricity through solar panels installed on a roof will mean that your source of electricity, the sun, will never run out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can sit back and relax as you will continue to have a reliable and unlimited power supply. As long as the sun continues shining, there will not be any power outages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Maintenance</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solar panels are durable and easily maintained. They only need to be dusted and washed a few times a year, and this can be done by hired professionals too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Earn Money</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can earn money by net metering as the homeowner gets compensated by sending their access electricity back to the power grid. Net metering is a billing system that permits the consumer to receive credits from the excess power that the solar panels at home generate. This system is being widely adopted around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Warranty And Increase Home Value</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solar system providers often provide long-term warranties for the unit&#8217;s performance. Some warranties offered can even be up to 20 to 25 years. The resale value of your home significantly increases if you have solar panels installed. It is a good investment as buyers today prefer to purchase homes that are energy efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Rebates And Incentives</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The federal government in the United States is promoting solar energy. Financial incentives are being offered to people switching to solar energy in their homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some other countries worldwide also give rebates and tax credits to homeowners with solar panels installed. Solar energy is the future of the world. It is all about smart consumption, and more and more people are turning to solar energy every day.</p></div>
